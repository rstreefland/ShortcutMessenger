# Shortcut Messenger

Shortcut Messenger is a decentralised (P2P) instant messaging application developed for my final year project (CS3IP16) at the University of Reading. It is written in Java and implemented from scratch using JoshuaKisson's Kademlia implementation as a reference https://github.com/JoshuaKissoon/Kademlia. It uses a modified implemention of the Kadmelia DHT protocol in order to discover and communicate with other nodes on the network.

It comes in two flavours, a CLI and GUI. Executable JAR archives for both varieties can be found in the /target folder. Native package, if available can be found in the /target/jfx/native folder.

Anyone using this should be aware that it was created only as an academic proof of concept and is not completed. There is a long list of known issues that I simply have run out of time to fix. I can give no guarantees of functionality or security so use it at your own risk. I will hopefully update this repository with more information once the project period is over.
